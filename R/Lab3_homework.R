# Homework Lab 3 -Measures I

# to read data into R:
# - make sure you set the pathway to the folder where you are storing the data 
# setwd()
load("Copper_Ore.RData")

# This data contains information about the international trade of copper ore in 2009.
# Nodes are countries.
# Ties tell you whether two countries traded copper together
 

# 1) print out information about the data set 
# how many nodes?
# how many edges?
# is it directed or undirected?
# which attributes?
# is it uni-partite?


# 2) Calculate the node degree appropriate for this kind of network and provide 
# the labels of the nodes with the highest degree.

# 3) What does node degree mean in this network?

# 4) Calculate the shortest path between the node with the highest degree 
# and the other four with the highest degree after it.

# 5) Are the 5 nodes with the highest degree close or far in network terms?

# 6) Calculate the diameter of the network

# 7) Calculate the average path length

# 8) Calculate the density of the network

# 9) Are there any cliques? If yes, how many nodes has the largest?

# 10) you have information about one network attribute. In which way this 
# attribute helps understanding what happens in this network?

# 11) subset two subgraphs that you think are relevant and tell me why

# 12) put the previous two sub-graphs together and plot them in a readable way

# 13) add labels to your plot

# 14) add the attribute to your plot
